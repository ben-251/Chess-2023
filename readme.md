# Chess, done right.

if you're here from my other chess program, you'll know what a riot it is, and you'll probably wonder
if the current ben is even capable of making a chess program that isn't such a mess.

Well i'm here to answer that question. 

I can. and i will. 


okay seriously though, the main reasons i'm doing this again:
1. It's a fairly simple program. It's a long process, but in terms of understanding, each process is fairly simple. I don't need to learn linear algebra or learn the fine detail of a strange module or anything.
2. Bad organisation is easy to spot. If my code starts to get messy (or "rot", as some would say) then because of how big the project is, it will be obvious.
3. (I promise this doesn't contradict 1.) there is a lot of room for creativity, and there are so many different ways to do things. This means that I can see new tools come into play (for example this time last year I clearly wasn't comfortable with enums or exceptions)
